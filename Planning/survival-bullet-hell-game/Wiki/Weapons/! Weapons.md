Weapons are the tools you'll use to dispatch the waves of ghosts coming after you!
There is a melee weapon and ranged weapon, but more variety can be gleamed through upgrades.

### Melee
[[Shovel]] - Your trusty gravedigging shovel! Somehow, you can hit ghosts with it.
Upgrades:
 - [[Haunted Shovel]] - Your shovel has started glowing a strange green hue! It pulses with building energy. 
 - [[Twin Trowels]] - Two expertly crafted trowels, identical to the last detail. Normally, you'd use these to plant an expert veggie garden.

### Ranged
[[Ecto Blaster]] - A scuffed up gun you found in an antiques shop. You thought it would be funny to have, given your profession.
 - [[Ecto Cannon]] - This big guy is a veritable hand cannon! Blast ghosts into next wednesday!
 - [[Ecto Burster]] - A strange contraption, this... thing spurts out bullets in bursts.
 - [[Ecto-no-more]] - Got ghosts on your toast? Whip out the Ecto-no-more! Banishes 99.9% of all ephemeral matter!
