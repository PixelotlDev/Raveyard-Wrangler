This slippery specter refuses to stay in one place! Full of energy and just as much malice, they'll try to make any time they have with you as entertaining for themself, and as ghoulish and terrifying for you, as they can.

### Attacks
 - Jab: A quick melee attack. They'll run in at their target, give it a hit, and then run away laughing their head off!
 - Teleport: This boss loves to zip around the place! This move has them teleporting a few times around the map, firing a shot at their target each time.
 - Bombs:
	 - Photo bombs: The boss spreads cameras around the map, which all go off with a flash one after the other. Get caught, and you'll be stunned!
	 - Joke Bombs: The boss spreads bombs around the stage, which all go off in a cloud of smoke one after the other. The smoke makes you laugh, which slows you down!
	 - Regular Bombs: The boss spreads bombs around the stage, which all go off in a ring of 8 bullets one after the other.

 - Friends: The boss calls on some friends! 5 random ghosts spawn nearby.
