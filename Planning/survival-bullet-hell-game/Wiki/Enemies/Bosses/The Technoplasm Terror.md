### Description
This boss spent most of their time in their lab, developing various technological wonders! Though, since there's been peace in ghost society for millennia, they've adapted most of them for party tricks.
To fight you, they've brought out their big party tank, kitted out with their own weaponry!

### Attacks
 - The tank itself deals 1 damage on contact with the target.

 - Confetti Cannon:
	 - Blast: A big wide blast of bullets that each do 1 damage on hit
	 - Power Shot: The cannon charges for a moment, before shooting one big slow bullet that deals 2 damage on hit, and explodes into many bullets after a short time.
	 - Mortar Mode: The cannon shifts, pointing straight up, and fires a volley of 10 bullets, which come crashing down around the target.
	 - Surround Shot: The cannon spins around the tank, firing 12 bullets in a circle around it

 - Friends: The boss calls some friends over! 3 ranged enemies spawn nearby.
