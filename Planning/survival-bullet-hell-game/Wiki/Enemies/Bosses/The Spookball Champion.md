### Description
This boss ghost was once the star of the local Spookball team! None could beat him, and he claimed countless souls on his track to become world champ! Unfortunately for him, spookball has since fallen out of fashion, though he never fails to bring it up at every party he attends.

### Attacks
 - Charge tackle: The ghost focuses their energy, before letting it propel them toward their target in three quick bursts. Deals 1 damage on each hit.
 
 - Spookball moves:
	 - Spike: The ghost throws the ball into the air, before slamming it toward their target. Deals 2 damage and bounces back on a hit. If it misses, the ghost will teleport to where the ball lands after a moment.
	 - Dribble: The ghost drops the ball to the ground, kicking it between their feet and gaining a small speed boost. This move ends with a big kick to the ball, sending it flying toward the target and dealing 2 damage on a hit.

 - Teammates: The ghost calls some of its former teammates over! 3 melee enemies spawn nearby.
