### Initial Pitch
Raveyard Wrangler is a 2D top-down survival roguelite bullet hell, based around high-intensity waves of [enemies](<Wiki/Enemies/! Enemies>), followed by a pause to recoup, get [buffs]((X)%20!%20Buffs.md Buffs>), and build [defences](<Wiki/Structures/! Structures>).

### Scenario
The game is set in a [graveyard](<Wiki/The Raveyard>) where the dead are coming back as spooky ghosts, intent on partying all night. You play as the grumpy old inexplicably cowboy-themed [groundskeeper](<Wiki/The Groundskeeper>), who just wants a peaceful night shift, free from the loud music and ghostly wails that have started plaguing the grounds when the sun goes down.

### Downscale
A massive downscaling has taken place due to time constraints and complications with making a 2D game in Unity3D, instead of Unity3D. Any file with (X) before the name is a removed feature, but has been kept for posterity.
